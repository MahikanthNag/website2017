We wanted to know which of them were solved by a particular student. After a lot of thought, I came up with this UI, where all the problems are on the top and we have a scrollable list of students below it. When you hover on the names, the problems that the guy solved gets highlighted.</p>\n<p><img src="https://preview.ibb.co/bz8Q6G/Screen_Shot_2017_10_15_at_2_50_35_PM.png" alt="leaderboard"></p>',frontmatter:{path:"/projects/mrnd-leaderboard",title:"MRND Leaderboard",technologies:"Angular, Firebase, Node",source:"https://github.com/aravindballa/MRNDLeaderboard",link:"http://mrnd.herokuapp.com"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
